Hi, welcome!

We, as Honey Honey Lab, is a small team of people who enjoy geeky things and strive to create something fun and, hopefully, useful.

Honey Honey Lab was founded around 2022 in Sydney, Australia. Initially, it started with just a few friends from different technical backgrounds working on a project because we had too much time on our hands. One project turned into two, then three, and the rest is history.

Currently, we have two main focuses:

- The first is developing network security testing devices, including extension boards for Flipper Zero, Marauder, and others.
- The second is modifying coffee machines, creating coffee gear, roasting our own brand of coffee, and hopefully, creating our own espresso machine in the future.
